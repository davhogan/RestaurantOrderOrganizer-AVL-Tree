# RestaurantOrderOrganizer-AVL-Tree

The purpose of this program is to reprsent a program that represent a food delivery  service app similar to Uber eats or grubhub.  
These delivery services allow for the user to order food from multiple different restaurants in a single order.  
While this gives the user more freedom it does make ordering a meal much more complicated. We canâ€™t assume a meal will be ordered all from one place.  
The delivery driver now needs to know all of the restaurants the user ordered from, instead of just getting the entire order from a single restaurant.  
Which is what program aims to do, to consolidate the items selected to a single order for each user.Then diplay those orders to the driver.
